My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, <br>
where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, <br>
and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, <br>
and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about <br>
twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, <br>
I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. <br>
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, <br>
like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, <br>
and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.<br>
